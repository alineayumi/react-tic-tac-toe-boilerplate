          Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (Commonwealth
          English), or Xs and Os (Irish English) is a paper-and-pencil game for
          two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid
          with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks
          in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a
          solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
